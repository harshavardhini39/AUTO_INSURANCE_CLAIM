# Insurance Claim Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is designed to predict insurance claim outcomes based on various features such as policy details, user information, and accident-related data. The goal is to provide insights into whether a claim is likely to be filed or not, allowing insurance companies to assess risk and make informed decisions.


### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
